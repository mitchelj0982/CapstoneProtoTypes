HelloWorld/build/web/HelloWorldFile.jsp
This is the path for the actual JSP file that you edit for the pages main HTML

I ran it using apache netbeans, and had to install the tomcat 9 web server FIRST before attempting the tutorial

https://dotnettutorials.net/lesson/jsp-using-netbeans-ide/
This is the tutorial. When I used the tutorial it didn't say you must install tomcat separately. 
Also when you instlal tomcat it will as you to make a username and password.
Which you will need to use at various points during the tutorial.

Finally since you installed tomcat before following the tutorial,
when you get to the step that says select server location select the location you just installed tomcat too.
If you used default location then the path will be the exact same as the tutorial.
